## AIM:
To write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark children aged 5 to 7.

## ALOGORITHM:

STEP-1: Introduce the main character — a little bat who is afraid of the dark. Show where he lives and how he feels at night.

STEP-2: Describe his problem — all other bats are happy flying at night, but he feels scared and stays inside.

STEP-3: Introduce a helper — maybe a firefly, owl, or moon who becomes his friend and teaches him about the beauty of the night.

STEP-4: Show how he overcomes his fear — with the helper’s guidance, he explores the night step by step and realizes it’s safe and magical.

STEP-5: End with a happy conclusion — the little bat now enjoys flying at night with his friends, and he’s no longer afraid of the dark.
## PROGRAM:
Benny was a small bat with the softest, fluffiest wings in the whole forest. He loved his cozy nook in the old willow tree, where golden sunlight would peek through the leaves during the day. But when the sun went down and the forest turned shadowy, Benny wished for a big, glowing lantern to carry everywhere — because he was terribly afraid of the dark.

One quiet night, a cool wind rustled the willow leaves. Benny’s friends swooped out to hunt, their laughter echoing in the night. But Benny stayed behind, hugging his branch. Suddenly, the gentle rustle stopped. The air felt still. Even the crickets held their breath.

“Oh no,” whispered Benny. “Something’s not right. I need to find out what happened!”
His tiny heart thumped, but he took a deep breath, stretched his wings, and fluttered into the dark.

Far ahead, a silver flash swept across the treetops. A deep “WHOOSH!” made Benny gasp. He darted behind a thick vine, trembling. “A night monster!” he thought.

Then a calm voice floated down. “Hello, little one. Why so jumpy?”
It wasn’t a monster — it was Luna, the silver moth, her wings glowing softly in the moonlight. “The night isn’t here to scare you,” she said kindly. “There’s a Moon’s Whisper waiting for you. It can make the darkness feel safe. Follow the glimmer of the stars.”

Benny nodded shyly and flew onward. Soon, he heard a soft “SWISH… SWISH…” in the shadows. A long tail flicked through the air. Benny’s ears twitched. “Another monster!” he squeaked.

But out of the shadows stepped Ripple, the gentle raccoon, carrying a bundle of fireflies in a leaf basket. “Looking for the Moon’s Whisper?” Ripple smiled. “Go to the tallest hill. It’s singing tonight.”

Benny flew up, his wings brushing the cool night air. At the top of the hill, the darkness seemed huge — but then he heard it. A low, soothing hum, like a lullaby wrapped in moonlight. Perched on a rock was Selene, the great white owl, her feathers glowing silver.

“This,” she said warmly, “is the Moon’s Whisper. It’s the sound of calm hearts and safe nights. Take it with you, Benny.” She brushed his cheek with a soft wing.

Benny felt a glow inside, brighter than any lantern. As he flew home, the forest no longer seemed scary — the shadows looked gentle, the stars sparkled like friendly eyes.

That night, Benny’s nook in the willow felt warmer than ever. His friends gathered close, and the Moon’s Whisper hummed softly in his heart. Benny knew now that the dark could be beautiful — and he would never fear it again.
